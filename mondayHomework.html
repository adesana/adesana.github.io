            <p>Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children divs.</p>
                <p>Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.</p>

    <ul>Here's what I like about lists:
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff.</li>
        <li>That's about it.</li>
        <li>I'm going to put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>When you make a list, do it in this order:
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not.</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag.</li>
        <li>Use li tags nested in the list for you list items</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>You're got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>

    <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag.</i></li>
    <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag.</b></li>
</ul>
